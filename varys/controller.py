class varys:
    """
    A high-level wrapper for the producer and consumer classes used by varys, abstracting away the tedious details.

    ...

    Attributes
    ----------
    profile : str
        profile name inside the configuration file to use when connecting to RabbitMQ
    configuration_path : str
        path to varys confiruration JSON file, provided with either the config_path argument or the VARYS_CFG environment variable
    __logfile : str
        the path to the logfile to use for logging, provided with the logfile argument
    __log_level : str
        the log level to use for logging, provided with the log_level argument, defaults to DEBUG (the most verbose logging level)
    __credentials : class
        an instance of the configurator class, used to store the RabbitMQ connection credentials
    __in_channels : dict
        a dictionary of consumer classes and queues that have been connected to for receiving messages
    __out_channels : dict
        a dictionary of producer classes and queues that have been connected to for sending messages

    Methods
    -------
    send(message, exchange, queue_suffix=False)
        Either send a message to an existing exchange, or create a new exchange connection and send the message to it. queue_suffix must be provided when sending a message to a queue for the first time to instantiate a new connection.
    receive(exchange, queue_suffix=False, block=True)
        Either receive a message from an existing exchange, or create a new exchange connection and receive a message from it. queue_suffix must be provided when receiving a message from a queue for the first time to instantiate a new connection. block determines whether the receive method should block until a message is received or not.
    receive_batch(exchange, queue_suffix=False)
        Either receive a batch of messages from an existing exchange, or create a new exchange connection and receive a batch of messages from it. queue_suffix must be provided when receiving a message from a queue for the first time to instantiate a new connection.
    get_channels()
        Return a dict of all the channels that have been connected to with the keys "consumer_channels" and "producer_channels"
